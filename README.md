### Virtual Synthesizer

"Virtual Synthesizer" is a project designed to emulate a musical synthesizer. It features a piano interface that allows users to click on each key to audibly play the corresponding note, generated through a JavaScript library called Tone.js. The interface also provides options for users to switch tone oscillators and adjust envelope settings, mimicking a real synthesizer.
